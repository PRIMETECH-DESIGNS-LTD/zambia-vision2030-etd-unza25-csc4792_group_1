        "Zambia’s Vision 2030 aims to transform the nation into a prosperous middle-income economy through sectoral\n",
        "development. However, tracking progress is hindered by:\n",
        "- Fragmented data: Emerging and Transformative Developments (ETDs) are siloed across\n",
        "government portals, reports, and international databases.\n",
        "- Manual classification: Current sector tagging of ETDs (e.g., agriculture, mining, ICT) is\n",
        "inconsistent, delaying policy adjustments.\n",
        "- Limited visibility: Policymakers lack a unified view of ETD distribution across Vision 2030’s 12\n",

        "\n",
        "### 1.2 Business Objectives\n",
        "- Automate ETD classification with ≥90% accuracy\n",
        "- Identify underfunded sectors through cluster analysis\n",
        "- Develop public dashboard for transparency\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Classification Accuracy**  \n",
        "  - Achieve a macro average F1-score of ≥ 0.85 for the automated sector classification model.  \n",
        "  - Validated through 10-fold cross-validation on held-out test data.  \n",
        "\n",
        "- **Cluster Interpretability**  \n",
        "  - Attain a Silhouette Score of ≥ 0.6 for unsupervised clustering of ETDs.  \n",
        "  - Clusters must be at least 80% interpretable by domain experts in relation to Vision 2030 sectors.  \n",
        "\n",
        "- **Policy Relevance**  \n",
        "  - Ensure ≥ 90% of classified sectors align with Zambia’s Eighth National Development Plan (8NDP) priorities.  \n",
        "  - Verified through manual review by Ministry of Finance experts.  \n",
        "\n",
        "- **Operational Efficiency**  \n",
        "  - Reduce manual tagging time by at least 70% compared to current processes.  \n",
        "  - Measured using a time-motion study.  \n",
        "\n",
        "- **Dashboard Performance**  \n",
        "  - Ensure public-facing dashboard loads in ≤ 2 seconds under standard network conditions.  \n",
        "  - Measured through automated performance testing.  \n",
        "\n",
