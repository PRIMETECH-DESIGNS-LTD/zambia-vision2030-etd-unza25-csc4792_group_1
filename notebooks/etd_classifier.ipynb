    "\n",
    "### **1.1 Problem Statement**\n",
    "Zambia’s Vision 2030 aims to transform the nation into a prosperous middle-income economy through sectoral\n",
    "development. However, tracking progress is hindered by:\n",
    "- **Fragmented data**: Emerging and Transformative Developments (*ETDs*) are siloed across\n",
    "government portals, reports, and international databases.\n",
    "- **Manual classification:** Current sector tagging of ETDs (e.g., agriculture, mining, ICT) is\n",
    "inconsistent, delaying policy adjustments.\n",
    "- **Limited visibility:** Policymakers lack a unified view of ETD distribution across Vision 2030’s 12\n",
    "priority sectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.2 Business Objectives**\n",
    "- Automate ETD classification with ≥90% accuracy\n",
    "- Identify underfunded sectors through cluster analysis\n",
    "- Develop public dashboard for transparency\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.3 Data Mining Goals**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classification Accuracy**  \n",
    "  - Achieve a macro average F1-score of ≥ 0.85 for the automated sector classification model.  \n",
    "  - Validated through 10-fold cross-validation on held-out test data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Cluster Interpretability**  \n",
    "  - Attain a Silhouette Score of ≥ 0.6 for unsupervised clustering of ETDs.  \n",
    "  - Clusters must be at least 80% interpretable by domain experts in relation to Vision 2030 sectors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Policy Relevance**  \n",
    "  - Ensure ≥ 90% of classified sectors align with Zambia’s Eighth *National Development Plan* (8NDP) priorities.  \n",
    "  - Verified through manual review by Ministry of Finance experts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Operational Efficiency**  \n",
    "  - Reduce manual tagging time by at least 70% compared to current processes.  \n",
    "  - Measured using a time-motion study.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Dashboard Performance**  \n",
    "  - Ensure public-facing dashboard loads in ≤ 2 seconds under standard network conditions.  \n",
    "  - Measured through automated performance testing.  \n",
    "\n",
